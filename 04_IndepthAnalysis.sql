# Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time.
# Find the no. of days taken to deliver each order from the orderâ€™s purchase date as delivery time.
# Also, calculate the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order.
# Do this in a single query.
# You can calculate the delivery time and the difference between the estimated & actual delivery date using the given formula:
# time_to_deliver = order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp
#diff_estimated_delivery = order_estimated_delivery_date - order_delivered_customer_date
# Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value.
# Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time.
# Find out the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery.
# You can use the difference between the averages of actual & estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the delivery was for each state.
