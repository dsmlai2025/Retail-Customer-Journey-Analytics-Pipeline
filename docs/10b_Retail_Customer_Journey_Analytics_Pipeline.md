# Retail Customer Journey Analytics Pipeline

### This project extends our earlier work by transforming it into a comprehensive end-to-end
data engineering solution leveraging cloud infrastructure. It demonstrates the full pipeline
from data ingestion and transformation to analysis and visualization in a scalable,
cloud-native environment.

### Dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

### Tools Used:
We will build a cloud-based pipeline that integrates Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon
Redshift, and Metabase for data analysis and visualization.

#### Steps:
1. Start with raw CSV files from the Olist dataset as the data source.
2. Ingest data into cloud storage using Amazon S3.
3. Use Amazon EC2 instances to perform data processing and transformations.
4. Load the transformed data into Amazon Redshift for efficient querying and analytics.
5. Utilize Metabase to create dashboards and visualize data insights.
6. Integrate these components into a seamless cloud-based data pipeline for end-to-end data engineering and analysis.
